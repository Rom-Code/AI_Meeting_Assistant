# Build an AI Meeting Assistant: Instant Notes, Zero Worries

## Estimated Effort: 45 minutes

In today's fast-paced work environments, creativity and collaboration drive innovation. Teams often participate in brainstorming sessions, strategy meetings, and problem-solving discussions, which are essential for shaping projects and organizational goals. However, the speed and volume of these interactions can pose significant challenges. Key ideas, critical decisions, and actionable tasks often slip through the cracks when relying on traditional manual note-taking methods. With so much information being exchanged, capturing every detail accurately becomes difficult, leading to unclear follow-ups, missed opportunities, and inefficiencies.

To address these challenges, the AI-Powered Meeting Assistant project offers a modern, transformative solution for meeting documentation. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and generative AI, this project equips participants with the tools to automate note-taking and extract critical insights efficiently.

Using advanced natural language processing, generative AI identifies and captures key meeting elements in real-time, including ideas, decisions, action items, and deadlines. This eliminates the need for manual note-taking, allowing team members to focus fully on the conversation without worrying about missing important details. The AI not only transcribes discussions but also organizes the content into clear, structured, and actionable meeting minutes. These organized records serve as a reliable resource that enhances clarity, improves follow-ups, and ensures teams stay aligned and productive as they move forward confidently.




## In this project, you will:

Familiarize yourself with Whisper: Begin by exploring Whisper, an application that converts audio speech to text. Understand its features, functionality, and limitations to ensure accurate transcription capabilities.

Build an initial app using Gradio: Create a simple app with Gradio, a Python library for building web-based interfaces. This step introduces you to handling audio inputs and outputs, preparing you for more advanced functionality.

Develop a complete speech-to-text application: Leverage your knowledge of Whisper and Gradio to design a robust speech-to-text application. Ensure it supports multiple audio formats and is user-friendly.

Explore IBM watsonx.ai LLM: Familiarize yourself with IBM watsonx.ai large language models (LLMs) to add advanced natural language processing features. Use these capabilities to improve the app's handling of transcriptions, such as context-aware corrections.

Preprocess speech-to-text transcripts: Clean and preprocess the transcriptions generated by the app. This includes adding proper punctuation, correcting errors, and structuring the text for readability and further analysis.

Utilize PromptTemplate and Chain: Incorporate PromptTemplate and Chain (from LangChain) to create advanced workflows. Use these tools to extend the app's functionality, such as generating summaries, extracting key points, or translating transcriptions.

Integrate and finalize: Bring all components together—Whisper, Gradio, IBM watsonx.ai LLM, and PromptTemplate workflows—into a cohesive Gradio application. The final product should deliver an end-to-end solution for converting and processing audio into polished, usable text.
